# Why Save a Model?

* Training takes time
* Deploy on multiple machines

!SLIDE

# ModelSerializer

* [JavaDoc for ModelSerializer](https://deeplearning4j.org/doc/index.html?org/deeplearning4j/util/ModelSerializer.html)
* writeModel Method
  * Writes configuration,weights and optionally the updater to file or output stream

# loadUpdater

* Updater is configuration needed for further training
* Without Updater model can be used for inference only
* With Updater model can be trained further
