# Convolutional Neural Network

* Inspired by the visual cortex
* Useful for image recognition



!SLIDE

# How Convolutional Neural Networks differ from other Networks

* Image data analyzed as 4D NDArrays (tensors)
* For a 10*10 image, a series of 3*3, or 5*5 subsets are analyzed

<!-- * Need more on Convnets -->
