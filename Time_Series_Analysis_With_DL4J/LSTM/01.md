# Long Short Term Memory RNN's

* Consider dynamic state of NN as Short term
* We want to make that last a long time
* Create modules that allow information to 
  * Gate in
  * Gate out when needed
  * In between gate is closed and information is preserved

# Long Short Term Memory RNN's

* Succesful for handwriting recognition
* Logistic write gate is turned on info is saved
* Rest of the network determines state of write gate
* Keep Gate determined by rest of Net
* Info gets read by turning on it's read gate
* All gates are managed by rest of the network
* Data in the memory cell is actually analog
* It writes the data back to itself at each step while "keep" is closed
* Weight of 1
