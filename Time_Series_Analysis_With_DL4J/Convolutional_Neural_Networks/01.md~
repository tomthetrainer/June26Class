# Convolutional Neural Networks

* Convolutional Neural Networks are best-inclass
today for image classification
* Uses locally connected filters to “scan” for
features In image data
	* Better able to deal with scale and rotation of image
features
* Typically is a repeating pattern of:
  * Convolution Layer
  * ReLU Layer
  * Pooling Layer

# Convolutional Image Explained

* Convolution layers “filter” x to extract features
  * Filters exploit (spatially) local regularities while preserving spatial relationships
* Subsampling (pooling) layers combine local information, reduce resolution
  * pooling gives translational invariance (i.e., classifier robust to shifts in x)
* Predict y from x with local structure (e.g., images, short time series)
  * 2D: classify images of, e.g., cats, cat may appear in different locations
  * 1D: diagnose patients from lab time series, symptoms at different times
* Special case: fully convolutional network with no MLP at “top” (filter for variablesized
x’s)
