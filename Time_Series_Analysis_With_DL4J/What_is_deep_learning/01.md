# What is Machine Learning?

* A method of solving problems that can not easilly be solved through hand written code. Instead build a program that "learns" or adjusts itself to attain the correct answer. 
* A program that creates a program.

# What is Machine Learning?

* Extracting Knowledge from raw data in the form of a model
  * Decision trees
  * Linear Models
  * Neural Networks

* Arthur Samuel quote:
  * "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"

# Why Machine Learning now? 

* Computing resources are getting cheaper and more powerful
* More data is available

# Machine Learning Compared to Data Science/Mining
* Data Mining
    * The process of extracting information from the data
    * Uses Machine Learning
* Data Science
  * Data Mining from the lens of a statistician
  * Venn Diagrams
  * A way to get a raise
  * A more agreeable Actuary
  * A statistician using a Mac

# Machine Learning Examples


* Clustering
* Typically unsupervised learning
	* “K-Means Clustering”
* Example
	* “cluster K groups of similar news articles together”
* ND4J supports this, but it is not  a NN

# A Definition of Deep Learning

* Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning, hierarchical learning or deep machine learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high level abstractions in data.

# Role of Artificial Neural Network


## Learns or Trains to perform tasks that traditional programming methods find rather challenging.
* Speech recognition 
* object recognition 
* computer vision 
* pattern recognition.

!SLIDE

# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning


* Supervised learning
  * We give the training process labels (“outputs”) for every training input data row
  * Model learns to associate input data with output value
* Unsupervised learning
  * No labels
  * Model attempts to learn structure in the data
* Neural Networks can be used for either supervised or unsupervised learning

# DeepLearning Considerations

* Inspired by the brain
  * Very basic implementation
* Brain has huge number of Neurons
* Brain has non-linear connections
* Creates similar distributed units of functionality
* Knowledge comes through connections

# The Rise and Fall of Neural Networks

* 40 year old theory and practice
* Hype cycle followed by delusion
* Repeat cycle
* Incremental improvements over time
