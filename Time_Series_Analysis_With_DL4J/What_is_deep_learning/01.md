# A Definition of Deep Learning

* Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning, hierarchical learning or deep machine learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high level abstractions in data.

# Role of Artificial Neural Network


## Learns or Trains to perform tasks that traditional programming methods find rather challenging.
* Speech recognition 
* object recognition 
* computer vision 
* pattern recognition.

!SLIDE

# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning


* Supervised learning
  * We give the training process labels (“outputs”) for every training input data row
  * Model learns to associate input data with output value
* Unsupervised learning
  * No labels
  * Model attempts to learn structure in the data
* Neural Networks can be used for either supervised or unsupervised learning

!SLIDE

# Clustering

* Typically unsupervised learning
	* “K-Means Clustering”
* Example
	* “cluster K groups of similar news articles together”
* ND4J supports this, but it is not  a NN
