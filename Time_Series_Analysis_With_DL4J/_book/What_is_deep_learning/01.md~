# What is Machine Learning?

* Extracting Knowledge from raw data in the form of a model
        * Decision trees
        * Linear Models
        * Neural Networks

* Arthur Samuel quote
  * "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"

# Machine Learning Compared to Data Science/Mining
* Data Mining
    * The process of extracting information from the data
    * Uses Machine Learning
* Data Science
        * Data Mining from the lens of a statistician
        * Venn Diagrams
        * A way to get a raise
        * A more agreeable Actuary
        * A statistician using a Mac

# Deep Learning

* Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning, hierarchical learning or deep machine learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high level abstractions in data.
