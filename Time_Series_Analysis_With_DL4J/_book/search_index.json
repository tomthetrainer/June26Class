The forget gate is represented as a linear identity function, because if the gate is open, the current state of the memory cell is simply multiplied by one, to propagate forward one more time step.\n\n\n\nWhy remember ?\nThink of text as a series of characters.

So again, the rest of the system is determining the state of a logistic keep gate, and if it keeps it on, then the information will stay there.\nAnd finally, the information gets read from the memory cell so that it then goes off to the rest of the recurrent neural network and influences future states and it's read by turning on a read gate, Which again is a logistic unit controlled by the rest of the neural network. \nThe memory cell actually stores an analog value, so we can think of it as a linear neuron that has an analog value and keeps writing that value to itself at each time step by a weight of one, so the information just stays there.\nGrab and create a version of his discussion about keep gates, Lecture 7 Final video. \n\n\n\nCursive handwriting recogntion\nInput is squence of pen coordinates as text is written\nOutput is sequence of characters\nGraves & Schmidhuber (2009)\nIf timing of pen is not known, the sequence of small images as input works\n\n\n\nFor Character Recognition\nAsk what the net knows...\nwords?

Overfitting means you get great performance on training data, but the network’s model is useless for out-of-sample prediction.\n\nRegularization helps: regularization methods include l1, l2, and dropout among others.\n\nThe larger the network, the more powerful, but it’s also easier to overfit. Don’t want to try to learn a million parameters from 10,000 examples – parameters > examples = trouble.\n\nMore data is almost always better, because it helps fight overfitting.\nTrain over multiple epochs (complete passes through the dataset).\nEvaluate test set performance at each epoch to know when to stop (early stopping).\nThe learning rate is the single most important hyperparameter. Tune this using deeplearning4j-ui; see this graph\nIn general, stacking layers can help.\nFor LSTMs, use the softsign (not softmax) activation function over tanh (it’s faster and less prone to saturation (~0 gradients)).\nUpdaters: RMSProp, AdaGrad or momentum (Nesterovs) are usually good choices. AdaGrad also decays the learning rate, which can help sometimes.\nFinally, remember data normalization, MSE loss function + identity activation function for regression, Xavier weight
