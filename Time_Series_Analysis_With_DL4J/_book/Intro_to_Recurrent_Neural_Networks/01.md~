# What is a Recurrent Neural Network?

* FeedForward Network with hidden state
* Hidden state with own internal dynamics
* Information can be stored in "hidden state" for a long time


-------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Benefit of RNN

* Instead of pre-configured window of time steps
* Flexible state information for flexible length events

# Hidden Markov models and speech recognition

Use for speech recognition in the 70's not neural net

Not sure I should mention them

# Benefits of RNN's

* Distributed Hidden State
* Several different units can be active at the same time
* Can remember several different things
* Non-linear can update hidden state in complicated ways
* Hinton quote
"With enough neurons and enough time, a recurring neuron network can compute anything that can be computed by your computer." coursera course

# More Benefits What can RNN's model, what behavior can they exhibit

* Oscillations, motor control, walking robot
* Settle to point attractors 

-------------------

# Challenges of RNN's

* Comp;exity makes them hard to train


-------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Training

* Back Propogation Through time
* think of it as feed forward network with constrained weights. 

Think of RNN as discrete time steps and (see Hinton Coursera)

# Training Goal, one sequence to another Sequence

* When modeling Sequential data we often want to turn one sequence into another sequence

* A phrase in english to a phrase in Spanish

* Sequence of audio ad convert into word identitites

-------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Training Goal

* Next timestep of current sequence

# Non Sequence data as Sequence data

* Pixels in an image , or Grid of pixels applied to next Grid
* works quite well, feels less natural
