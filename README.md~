# Overview of process for building the materials and other details

## Lab IntelliJ project

Let's use this one. 

https://github.com/tomthetrainer/class_labs

As far as I know it has ALL the possible Labs I have ever written in it. 

The structure is. 

### Demos

Stuff for the isntructor to demonstrate. Currently a simple network to show UI and basic hyper parameters, VGG16, and a spark transform with Datavec

### Labs

This is where the student works, stubbed out file with comments that match the isntructions from the Lab PDF

### Solutions

Complete working solutions

# Building the content. 

The Presentation(slides) are delivered with showoff from puppet labs. 

You build MarkDown, Table of Contents is JSON, apply CSS as needed. The pages rendered are html so html tags can be used as well as Markdown. 

# Presenting the content

Switch to the directory "Time_Series_Analysis_With_DL4J"

Run "showoff serve"

This will launch a Sinatra Ruby web server with the content. 

## Running the Presenter window. 

http://localhost:9090/presenter

Is the presenter window. You will see Nav Panel on left, Slide being server in center and Instructor notes below. 

## Controlling a Slave Window
