# Deep Learning: Building Neural Networks using DeepLearning4J
## Course Outline
###Day 1
Goals of Day 1 is to provide the background and introductions they need to understand the rest of the course. Day 1 is also for introductions and to get to know the needs of the students and if the course is on track to meet their needs. 

Also in day 1 the goal is to mix the lecture with some hands on labs. I like to see a Lab before lunch on Day. 

### Intro to Deep Learning

Cover chapters 1-4 of the book in a half a day at most. 

**note to Tom ** Grab Dave Kale's description of a NN from the video at Work Day where he succinclty describes a NN in short truncated mathematical terms. 

Key Topics
* Show they are used today, talk to your phone, image recognition, 
* Then History ** keep it quick and snappy Hit them with some math so they know it is attainable, but that it is math
* Inspired by physical Nuerons
* Perceptron ** find something easy to grasp, probably perceptron
* Chapter 2 steal from that.
* Steal from Melanie Presentation nice overview

### Lab 1 

Setting up your environment and running a canned example. 

In this Lab we will set up Intellij with all the needed dependencies to run dl4j. 

### Lab postscript

Show them the pieces, DL4j, ND4J, DataVec and discuss the roles of each

** I predict day 1 Lunch to fall about here

### Data Ingestion into your Neural Network using DataVec

** The BASICS !!
** DataVec is not sexy, Nueral Nets are, they need to know DataVec but I want to keep this first part basic, so nothing too complex, ingest data that is already numeric, already well formed. Something like MLPClassifierLinear from examples.

### Lab: Data Ingestion using DataVec

### Choosing the right network:

Quick into to the choices and what fits for classification, Image Recognition etc. 

### Columnar data and Multi Layer Perceptron

### Lab Venus

Take most of this chapter's inspiration from 
the chapter "Modeling CSV Data with Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks"

** I predict Day 1 to end around here

### Recognizing Hand Written Digits with CNN's

##### The DataVec needed to get this done

Mnist Lenet

### Lab Modeling Hand-Written Images with Convolutional
Neural Networks

** End of Day two

### Constructing human sentences with RNNs

#### The DataVec needed to get this done

### Lab Shakespeare with LSTM

** Show off LagerBot

** Take inspiration from this chapter in the book "Modeling Sequence Data with Recurrent Neural Networks"

** Day 3 lunch I am probably way off, not sure how long the DataVec piece of each section will take

### Tuning Neural Networks

Chapter 6 from the book. 

Chapter 6 is not particularly lab focussed, extract the concepts from that chapter and build labs where they change the parameters and get more comfortable with tweaking the code.

* Key Concepts:
* Number of Layers
* Parameter Count
* Weight Initialization
* Loss Function
* Mini Batching Regularization

** I predict Day 3 to end around here
