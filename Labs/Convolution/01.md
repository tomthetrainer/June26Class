# Building a Convolutional Neural Network

A convolutional Neural Network differs from a Feed Forward Neural Network by having Convolutional Layers, followed by MaxPooling Layers. 

A convolutional Layer looks at a subset of the image in a moving window across the complete image. As each region of the window is evaluated the model learns to detect useful features, regardless of where they occur in the image. 

A MaxPooling Layer is used after a Convolutional layer. Pooling Layers function to reduce the spatial size of the representation to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network.

# Lab Step 1:

Open the Class ConvNeuralNet and uncomment/delete the two lines with  

<-- DELETE THIS LINE --> .


The open comment line
```
/* <-- DELETE THIS LINE -->
```
and the close comment line
```
 <-- DELETE THIS LINE --> */
```

# Lab Step 2: 

Most of the code here is exactly the same as the FeedForward Neural Network Example. 

The Network will be modified and the two hiddel layers will be replaced with a Convolutional Layer a MaxPooling Layer. The Output Layer will remain more or less the same. 

Add the Convolutional Layer. 

```
.layer(0, new ConvolutionLayer.Builder(5, 5)
    //nIn and nOut specify depth. nIn here is the nChannels and nOut is the number of filters to be applied
        .nIn(channels)
        .stride(1,1)
        .nOut(20)
        .activation(Activation.IDENTITY)
        .build())
```						

# Lab Step 3:

Add the MaxPooling Layer.


```
.layer(1, new SubsamplingLayer.Builder(SubsamplingLayer.PoolingType.MAX)
    .kernelSize(2,2)
    .stride(2,2)
    .build())
						
```						


# Lab Step 4:

Add the Output Layer

Note that this is very similar to the output Layer used in the FeedForward Network. 


```
.layer(2, new OutputLayer.Builder(LossFunctions.LossFunction.NEGATIVELOGLIKELIHOOD)
                        .nOut(outputNum)
                        .activation(Activation.SOFTMAX)
                        .build())
```

# Lab Step 5: 

Run the Convolutional Neural Network and compare the accuracy to the accuracy of the FeedForward Network. 

In a single epoch run the convnet may misclassify a 5 as a 6, or a 3 as an 8. 


# Extra Credit:

Try to improve the performance of the Convolutional Network. 

* Add more Layers

The Very Succesful Image Recognition Neural Networks have 16 or more layers. 

Add one or more pairs of Convolutional Layer followed by maxPooling Layers. 

* Modify the size of the Convolution Layers

This line ```ConvolutionLayer.Builder(5, 5)``` Specifies a 5 pixel by 5 pixel window will be examined, and this line ```.stride(1,1)``` specifies to move the window over 1 pixel and repeat till end of line and then down one pixel. 

Modifying those settings and see if you can get better results.
